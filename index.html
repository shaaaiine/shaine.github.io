                        <p>I am a year 1 student in the Common Business Programme and just learnt that I am an ENTJ-A or the rather popular personality type known as The Commander. ENTJs are considered to be daring, goal-driven, and natural leaders, and it is exactly what matches my self-perception. I prefer to take initiative and in activities where I can bring order, systems, or find a team a goal to achieve.</p>

                        <p>My greatest areas of interest are business strategy, service excellence, and entrepreneurship. I especially love the idea of launching my own company on the beauty market, and I have already commenced my progress, studying the approaches to branding, operations, and experience on the client side. I am also practical, though I have understood that both structure and creativity are necessary to succeed.</p>

                        <p>An event which made me learn that lesson was when I participated in the FedEx International Trade Challenge and I represented Singapore and was forced to team up with a fellow representative of another country. The language barrier and the time pressure were very demanding in the initial stages of the project. We went to loggerheads, did not perform the way they expected us to do in the initial stages but I changed. My presentation of communications changed and we at the end came up with a market strategy that we could be proud of. That incident made me realize again that failure is a feedback and not a defeat.</p>

                        <p>A highlight of which I am particularly proud is combining work in a part time job with an internship in a DBS contact centre and still acing my requirements in school. It was not easy, yet I realised how to set priorities, endure burnout, and be disciplined, which I consider to be my essential needs.</p>

                    <p>I chose the Common Business Programme because I was not eager to take a certain direction, yet I was eager to do something meaningful in the business environment. The versatility of CBP makes it appropriate to my curiosities and ambition, as CBP allows me to go into various industries before specialising.</p>

                    <h3 class="font-bold text-xl mb-2 text-[#8C6D76]">💡 My Beliefs & What Drives Me</h3>
                    <p>I also base my beliefs on individual responsibility and influence. I am sure that when you have a chance of making something better, you could do it. I appreciate resilience, more so in a rapidly-changing world and hence I attempt to become a role model by being consistent and dynamic.</p>

                    <h3 class="font-bold text-xl mb-2 text-[#8C6D76]">🌱 Values in Action: BA Cares & Uplifting Others</h3>
                    <p>The creation of uplifting experiences is one of the things that mean a lot to me. This can be in the form of beauty services, nice service in a corporate world, or just volunteering. I love to make people feel heard, seen and of value. That is why I signed up to BA Cares, volunteering allows me to also make a difference in a way that reflects my own values and ideas of being caring and appreciative.</p>

                    <p>After five to ten years, I would be either operating my own beauty shop or working in a corporation where I will play an active role in a team's success, either in HR or in operations. I desire that people use me as an example of what to do and follow me.</p>
                    <p class="mt-4">The importance of ethics to me is that without trust, there is no relationship whether at the personal stage or the professional one. It can be in honouring the feedback of a customer or helping out a fellow team member; in all this I believe in doing what is right even in the absence of an observing eye.</p>

                           <p><strong>1. International Trade & Business:</strong> I am attracted by this course since it gives access to international markets and business. Global Business Environment, International Trade Law and Supply Chain Management modules will provide me with the interaction knowledge of a foreign business, which is a crucial element in case I develop a beauty brand globally or manage foreign imports of my goods.</p>
                           <p><strong>2. Accounting:</strong> With accounting, I get a good background in financial literacy, which is helpful in running a business or being employed in a corporation. Modules like Financial Accounting, Cost Accounting, and Taxation will help me understand cash flow, budgeting, and strategic financial planning.</p>
                           <p><strong>3. Banking & Finance:</strong> This is a decision that proves my interest which might be working in corporate finance. Courses like the Investment Analysis, Bank Operations and Financial services marketing will form the knowledge base necessary within my job career like Analyzing the finance or position holders in the banking sector.</p>
                           <p class="italic">In all the courses, I look forward to Final Year Projects and internships that bring real world utilisation. I will consider short holiday internships in order to gather experience early.</p>

                            <p>I joined BA Cares, a volunteering CCA, as I like to give back. The aspect of volunteering enables me to inculcate the sense of empathy, cooperation, and responsibility, which is valuable in any profession, particularly, service and people-oriented professions, such as HR or entrepreneurship.</p>
                            <p>External to school, I have been proactive in attempting the various part time jobs such as a cafe, and contact centre. These jobs have made me understand professionalism, patience, and time. They also made me come out of my comfort zone and learned to speak to people of various categories.</p>
                             <p class="italic">I support the idea of setting an example. Ethical behaviour in student life is to appear, be responsible and respect others, things that I do in school and in any other place.</p>

                                <p>To pursue this path, I plan to complete a Professional Eyelash Extension Course at The Lash Academy Singapore. This course offers hands-on training along with foundational knowledge in salon operations. I also intend to take online courses in small business management and digital marketing through LinkedIn Learning to strengthen my understanding of branding, customer experience and entrepreneurship.</p>

Such courses as TikTok Marketing 101 on Coursera or LinkedIn Learning, or Digital Media and Content Creation are the courses that I would consider enrolling in. These will help me advance a sincere personal brand and create content that is interesting but also professional.</p>

If I select Human Resources, I may also pursue a part-time diploma from SHRI. If I opt for Finance, I will take Excel and financial analysis courses to build my technical proficiency and industry readiness.</p>
